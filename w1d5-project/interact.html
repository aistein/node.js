  Today we will be reviewing how JavaScript can work with HTML!

  PLEASE: Grab one of the staff if you're having any trouble! This is not a test!
  
  NOTE: There's a template at the bottom of this file for you to code in! Copy the template and paste it into your code editor to get started!

  Friendly Reminders:
  - There is some already written JavaScript and HTML code that you will be modifying. Just ignore it until Section 1, #7.

  Please follow these instructions carefully and write your code below.

    ==== SECTION 1: HTML & JavaScript ====
      1) Create a `div` element with an `id` attribute of 'logMe'.
      2) Define a variable `logMyElement` and assign the value to the querySelector result for 'logMe'. (HINT: Be sure to have this JavaScript code inside of your page's <script> tag!)
      3) Log the variable `logMyElement` to the console. Observe the console and think about how querySelector works.
      4) Create a `div` element with an `id` attribute of 'myAwesomeDiv'.
      5) Define a function named `updateAwesomeDiv` that will update the textContent of 'myAwesomeDiv' when called.
      6) Call this function observe the newly updated content!
      7) Modify the already existing `addEventListener` function to change the `topHeader` div to have the content of the `customInput` input.
      8) Observe the capabilities you might have when it comes to dynamically modfying elements on a page.
      9) EXTRA CREDIT: Create a text input and a button that appends a new list item for each button click. Imagine it to be a one-person chatroom. Try figuring out how to clear the input field on each submission.
      10) EXTRA EXTRA CREDIT: Create button to clear the list elements. Imagine it to be a 'Clear History' feature.
      11) FINISHED EARLY?: Read about more ways to mofify the DOM using JavaScript: http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/#elements

    ==== SECTION 2: Get your wheels spinning ====

      1) Who invented JavaScript? When was it invented and standardized? (HINT: Google!)
      
      3) What is the use of assigning an element an `id` attribute as opposed to a class?
      
      
IMPORTANT: Once you're finished, please upload this file to a GIST (gist.github.com) and send the link via Slack to @tylerlambe.
WARNING: DO NOT send it to the class channel.
